# Note: If you are using mods that create custom items / prefabs, you might need to add and configure them
#       explicitly by creating your own groups for those. Predefined groups only contain Valheim's original
#       items.

# Define your own groups here and assign items via display name (or the internal ID) to your groups.
# Hint: If you want to find the internal ID of an item, you can look it up in the wiki.
# https://valheim.fandom.com
# For custom items, please refer to the documentation of the mod that adds them.
